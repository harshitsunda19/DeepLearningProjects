# DeepLearningProjects
This repository contains all my deep learning projects I have worked upon. I will also be updating my repository when required. Please note that all the files are in the .ipynb format.

Kindly aslo note that there are some projects which I have created using Google Colab. You may view those projects on Colab. The link to Colab will be shared in the file itself.

Following are the Projects I have worked upon:

1) German Traffic Signs Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) : This is based on a dataset which is provided on Kaggle. The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification database which has 43 different traffic signs under various sizes and in different conditions and sizes. It is a large, life-like database It has about 39000 training set images and 12000 test set images. 

2) Game of Deep Learning: This is based on a dataset contaiing various types of ships and to classify them based on their various set of features. This dataset is from a competition which was held by Analytics Vidhya. There are 6252 images in training data and 2680 images in test data. This dataset also has 5 differenct types of ships to classify from. These are: Cargo, Military, Carrier, Cruise, & Tankers
