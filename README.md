# DeepLearningProjects
This repository contains all my deep learning projects I have worked upon. I will also be updating my repository when required. Please note that all the files are in the .ipynb format.

Kindly aslo note that there are some projects which I have created using Google Colab. You may view those projects on Colab. The link to Colab will be shared in the file itself.

Following are the Projects I have worked upon:

1) German Traffic Signs Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) : This is based on a dataset which is provided on Kaggle.

It is a large, life-like database It has about 39000 training set images and 12000 test set images.
